# Status

As known to all who need to know, my venues of communication are currently
limited. Google products are not readily accessible, nor, to my surprise is
Slack. Disqus, the comment provider on this website, is also seemingly blocked,
which means you can leave messages, but I can't see them. Github, though, is
all jolly good.

In the near future, I will tunnel through these walls, but for now, if you want
to communicate with me, post an issue at [this github pages
repo](https://github.com/arendsee/arendsee.github.io) or at [the coding group
repo](https://github.com/arendsee/coding-group).
