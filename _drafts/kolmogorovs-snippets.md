title: Kolmogorov's snippets
---

I don't like memorizing things, especially ...

I gradually found that I wrote lots of snippets for certain languages
(e.g. LaTeX, C, C++). I began to build a workflow for learning a new
language. First get a hello world program running. Then write a Makefile
snippet that expands to a default build. Then get syntax highlighting the
way I want. Then start learning the syntax, building my own snippets as
I go. I never use other peoples snippets, I'd rather build them as I need
them, then delete them as I don't, this way I will gradually evolve the
set optimal for me. 

Then I began learning Haskell. I wrote a snippet for the Makefile, I wrote
a snippet for `main`, a snippet for a module. But these were all very
trivial. I found I didn't need snippets. Which made me think about
Kolmogorov complexity. You don't need snippets in Haskell because there is
so little boilerplate.
