Many bioinformatics programs, such as HMMER, rely on a random model that
describes the composition of a genome. These models are often trained on the
genome itself. For example, HMMER builds transition matrices from whole genomes
(or do they, double check). For any HMM model, or almost any other
probabilistic model that might use composition data, the dependence on base
frequencies or transition probabilities is exponential. For example, in a
simple model assuming independence between bases, the probability of observing
the sequence "TTTTACC" would be $p_T^4p_Ap_C^2$. In an AT rich isochore, $p_T$
may be 30%, in an AT poor isochore, it may be 20% ... go on to show how
extremes things are way more common with isochores ....
