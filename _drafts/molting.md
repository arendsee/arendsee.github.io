I have a hard time reading other people's code. It is embarrassing to admit, but
I would usually rather reimplement something from scratch then even learn how
someone else's API works. I am really slow.

I worked in Java, Perl, Python, C++, R; I never felt I really understood any of
these languages. C++ was the worst. It seemed of near fractal complexity. For
every problem there were a dozen solutions, and there were interactions between
all of them. For example, you can overload a function and have default
arguments, both are easy enough to understand, but how do they interact? You
can have templates, and ... There are four ways to caste. C++ could be fun, I'd
have the occasional twinge in my gut -- same feeling I had for my crush in high
school -- when I some piece of the puzzle slipped into place, or when I for
a moment saw some new plain in the C++ landscape. But as my project grew,
I realized I couldn't understand my own code.

C was a thing of beauty. I understand why some people dislike it. The safety
issues, the difficulty of doing certain simple things. But I could understand
my code. I could step through my entire program in my mind. I knew nearly all
the syntax of the language (barring some arcane pieces of the preprocessor).
The syntax was easy, I could focus on solving problems.

I took one major project in C and converted it to C++. It was wonderful
rewriting all my adhoc structure-centered "classes" into real classes with
real private functions (rather than just functions defined only in source
files). But the power of C++ is seductive, I kept on refactoring and
generalizing. Replacing my sometimes repetitive and verbose C solutions with
templates and classes.
