<p><a href="https://github.com/morloc-project/morloc">morloc</a> is a functional programming
language where functions are imported from foreign languages and unified
through a common type system. The compiler generates the code needed to compose
functions across languages and also to direct automation of mundane tasks such
as data validation, type/format conversions, data caching, distributed
computing, and file reading/writing. In the far future, I hope to develop
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">morloc</code> into a query language that returns optimized programs from an infinite
“library” of functions and compositions of functions.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="other">Other</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/arendsee/language-of-dice">Language Of Dice</a> was my
first attempt at developing a programming language. The goal was to develop
a language for specifying discrete probability problems (dice problems) that
was sufficiently advanced to model outcomes of encounters in D&amp;D. For
example, what is the probability that my group of 3 level-2 fighters will
beat the Kraken. All possible attacks, buffs, debuffs, etc would have to be
modeled. The project currently consists only of loose specification of
syntax, grammar, and a rudimentary lexer and parser.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="r-shiny-apps">R Shiny apps</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/arendsee/metaoku">metaoku</a>
(<a href="https://metaoku.shinyapps.io/archive/">app</a>) was my grand vision for a means
of sharing and visualizing data organized into normal folders. The project is
described in my dissertation appendix. The project is basically dead now, but
it seemed my approach to automatically visualizing data and my simlple data
type-system are worth returning to at some point.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/arendsee/orphan-survey">Orphan survey</a>
(<a href="http://arendsee.shinyapps.io/orphan-survey">app</a>) is a Shiny visualization
program for an unpublished orphan gene study I ran in grad school. Nothing come
of it ultimately.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/arendsee/dnd">dnd</a>
(<a href="http://arendsee.shinyapps.io/dnd-rolls">app</a>) is a rudimentary dice
probability app. Someday, when I feel sufficiently motivated, I’ll come back to
it and expand the functionallity. Dice probability gets interesting when you
start adding in advantage/disadvantage and other D&amp;D shenanigans.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/arendsee/interstellar">Small population survival</a>
(<a href="http://arendsee.shinyapps.io/interstellar">app</a>) was a visualization app for
a class project concerning how long a colony on a generation ship would survive
before the proportion of females reched 0 or 1 and natural reproduction became
impossible.</p>
