This is my first post from Manchuria.

I am currently unable to access Google or Slack, but Github is clear. I thus
have access to all my repositories and this website. Also I can access the main
online scientific resources I use (e.g. NCBI) as well as general programming
resources (e.g. my package manager databases and CRAN). So I have everything
I need to do my normal work.

My difficulties are in communication with the rest of the team. As a partial
remedy, I have built a repository for practicing bioinformatics programming
and have added our three new graduate students as collaborators. This will be
a venue for communication with most of my team (through issue "forums").

As soon as possible, I will get a VPN running. This will let me bypass the wall and communicate via normal channels.
