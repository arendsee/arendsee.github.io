# Python packages on PyPi

 * [pgraphdb](https://github.com/arendsee/pgraphdb) is a Python library and CLI
   tool for interacting with a GraphDB database. It allows uploading of RDF
   data, submission of SPARQL queries, deletion of triples specified in RDF
   files, etc.

 * [octofludb](https://github.com/flu-crew/octofludb) is a specialized tool for
   parsing the data used in our swine influenza surveillance program into
   triple format and uploading it to a GraphDB database. It allows access to
   the data through SPARQL queries and can return FASTA file sequence.

 * [smof](https://github.com/incertae-sedis/smof) is a CLI tool for working
   with FASTA files.

 * [regref](https://github.com/arendsee/regref) offers regular expression based
   search and replace using pattern and replacement expressions from a table.

 * [smot](https://github.com/flu-crew/smot) is a python package and CLI tool
   for general purpose phylogenetic tree sub-sampling, annotation, and
   summarization.

 * [flutile](https://github.com/flu-crew/flutile) is a specialized suite of
   tools designed for the flu-crew at
   [USDA-ARS](https://www.ars.usda.gov/midwest-area/ames/nadc/#) and
   collaborators.

# R CRAN/rOpenSci packages

 * [rmonad](https://github.com/arendsee/rmonad) an experimental monadic
   pipeline tool for building branching workflows, storing select intermediate
   data, automatic benchmarking, and storing of any raised error messages or
   warnings.

 * [rhmmer](https://github.com/arendsee/rhmmer) a wrapper around the
   bioinformatics package HMMER.

 * [onekp](https://github.com/ropensci/onekp) scrape plant transcritomic data
   from the 1KP project website, select the species or clades or interest, and
   automatically download them.

# Grad-school jetsam

 * [synder](https://github.com/arendsee/synder) is a high-performance program
   that maps genomic loci from one species to another using a synteny map. The
   core algorithm is written in C++ and wrapped in R.

 * [phylostratr](https://github.com/arendsee/phylostratr) an buggy little R
   tool I made as a graduate student and that has unfortunately become popular
   enough that people pester me for updates and fixes.

 * [fagin](https://github.com/arendsee/fagin) another project I developed as a
   graduate student that, fortunately, no one uses.
